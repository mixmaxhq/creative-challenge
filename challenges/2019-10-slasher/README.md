# October 2019: Slasher

It's Halloween, and we're feeling spooky! This month, your challenge is to write an open-source slash command (or one of the other customizations we support, such as enhancements, link resolvers, or sidebars) along with instructions on how an avid Mixmax user could use your code for themselves. Let's show off some neat tricks that Mixmax can be customized to do!

Bonus points for:
* Hosting the API somewhere unique. See [here](https://github.com/anaibol/awesome-serverless#hosting-and-code-execution-in-the-cloud) for possibilities!
* Following up with a blog post.

Don't know how to get started writing a slash command? Check out [this blog post](https://engineering.mixmax.com/blog/create-a-mixmax-slash-command-using-webtask-io) for a how-to.
