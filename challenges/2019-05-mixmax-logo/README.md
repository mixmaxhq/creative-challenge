# May 2019: Mixmax Logo

Your challenge is to write code that causes the observer to perceive the Mixmax “M” logo.

This means the following are all valid entries:
* A bash script that outputs ASCII art representing the Mixmax logo.
* A javascript one-liner that renders an SVG of the Mixmax logo.
* A Go executable that adds a 3-D rendering of the Mixmax logo to a given photograph.
* A C executable that produces a sound that causes the listener to hallucinate the Mixmax logo.
* An INTERCAL executable that overheats the user’s laptop in such a way that the keyboard melts into the shape of the Mixmax logo.
* A computer virus that infects the world’s computers, causing them to tweak stock trade amounts in such a way that the prices of stocks on the NYSE are subtly changed over the course of weeks until the New York Times stock listings form a stereogram which, when viewed, results in the Mixmax logo. (Note: Mixmax may waive liability in this case.)

As long as the logo is recognizable, it’s valid. There are no further restrictions.
