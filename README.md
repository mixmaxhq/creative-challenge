# Mixmax Creative Code Challenge
Periodic challenges to exercise your coding and creative skills.

## The Concept
When a new challenge begins, you'll be presented with a task to accomplish by writing some code, and a deadline for delivery. Generally, the guidelines are pretty relaxed: feel free to be creative in the tools you use and how your solution works. Individual challenges may set more strict rules.

Specifically, you should put some thought into these two aspects:
* _Form_, or how impressive & creative your entry's construction/format is.
* _Execution_, or how well your entry does what it's supposed to.

After you complete your entry, you should consider presenting your solution at the next engineering coworking session and/or writing up a blog post about it.

## Tips
* Be clever! This is a chance to show off quirky and cool code tricks that you wouldn't necessarily ship into production.
* Think about the aesthetics of the code you write. "Nicely formatted" isn't always best.
* Include info on how to set up and run your submission.
* Experiment with unusual languages & technologies.
* Create more than one entry if you have more than one idea!
* Collaborate with others! Share the glory!

## How to Enter
* Clone this repo: `git clone ssh://git@github.com/mixmaxhq/creative-challenge.git`
* Create a new branch for your entry: `git checkout -b username/my-entry`.
* Your entry should be in a subdirectory with your username inside the subdirectory for the challenge. E.g. Alice's entry for the May 2019 challenge would be in `creative-challenge/challenges/2019-05-mixmax-logo/alice`. If she submits a second entry, it could live in an `alice-2` subdirectory.
* Make sure the instructions for running your entry are in a `README.md` file in your subdirectory.
* Submit a PR when ready, and merge it when your entry is complete. No code review is necessary, but if your code doesn't work it's not as impressive.
